# Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for forecasting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock price data to predict future prices, providing a valuable tool for financial analysis and trading strategies.

## Overview

Stock price forecasting is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. This project leverages the power of LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model and predict stock prices. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/puneetgani/Stock-Price-Forecasting-with-LSTM.git
cd Stock-Price-Forecasting-with-LSTM
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook stock_forcasting_lstm.ipynb
```
3. Run the notebook cells to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. You can modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different parameters and models.

## Project Structure
- stock_forcasting_lstm.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for stock price forecasting with LSTM.

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations of the predicted vs. actual stock prices, model performance metrics, and other relevant analyses. By following the steps in the notebook, you can train the LSTM model on your own stock price data and observe its forecasting performance.
